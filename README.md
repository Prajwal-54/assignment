### question 1 
Write a program that takes as input a sorted array of numbers. The objective is to return the array arranged in an alternate order such that max value is followed by min value in a descending fashion, so that the 1st element is the max value, 2nd element is the min value, 3rd element is the second max value, 4th element is the second min value & so on.

<pre>
TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n)<br/>
SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)<br/>
POSSIBLE TEST CASES : []            -> []<br/>
                      [1]           ->  []<br/>
                      [1,3]         -> [3,1]<br/>
                      [1,3,4,5,6]   -> [6,1,5,3,4]<br/>
                      [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> [7,1,6,2,5,4]<br/>
</pre>
### question 2
Please implement a software for a Coffee House using Object Oriented Programming. If you are not familiar or comfortable with object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a quick read to ensure you understand it before you attempt it.
It should have the following features:
- Allow users to order a coffee from Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte.
- Allow users to specify add-ons: Milk, Cream, Latte<br/>
<pre>
Prices for the available options are as follows
Product/Add-on     Milk     Cream     Latte
Espresso           60       75        100
Cappuccino         80       90        125
Latte              100      125       150
</pre>
